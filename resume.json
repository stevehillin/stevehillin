Built an integration to leverage ChatGPT to help solve IT issues, augmenting technical staff.  Built internal security API via Python FastAPI to ingest webhooks to inspect passwords and check against HaveIBeenPwned hashed passwords, then report the bad password to the engineer or customer who set it.  Replaced built-in Connectwise Manage plugin for Automate that ran more efficiently and effectively to sync workstation counts to Manage for billing.  Automated the backup and retrieval of ITGlue backups for offsite storage.  Leveraged Connectwise Manage API to produce quick reports and data much faster than existing manual processes.",
